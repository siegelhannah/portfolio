## Overview

This map visualizes housing unit vacancy rates across the United States, highlighting geographic disparities in housing availability and occupancy.

## Cartographer’s Statement

**Audience & Purpose**  
This map is designed for a general audience interested in housing patterns, including students, planners, and policy-curious viewers. The goal is to make regional vacancy trends legible at a national scale.

**Concepts & Narrative**  
The map draws on principles of thematic cartography to communicate socioeconomic variation through spatial patterning, emphasizing regional differences rather than individual local detail.

**Design Choices**  
A choropleth design was chosen to represent vacancy rates by geographic unit. A sequential color scheme reinforces increasing intensity while avoiding unnecessary visual complexity. Classification breaks were selected to balance statistical distribution with interpretability.

**Data Sources & Processing**  
Data were obtained from publicly available U.S. housing datasets. Vacancy rates were calculated from raw housing counts, then joined to geographic boundaries. Some variables and finer spatial resolutions were omitted to maintain clarity and avoid misinterpretation at a national scale.

**Ethical & Accuracy Considerations**  
The map reflects aggregated data and cannot represent individual housing experiences. Care was taken to avoid overstating causality or implying uniform conditions within mapped units.

**Relationship to Subject**  
My approach to this topic was shaped by an interest in how large-scale data can reveal structural housing trends while still requiring careful interpretation.

**Process & Tools**  
The map was created using GIS software, with iterative refinement of classification, color, and layout to improve readability.

**Intended Experience**  
I hope viewers notice both broad regional patterns and areas of contrast that prompt further inquiry into housing dynamics.

**Limitations**  
This map cannot show temporal change, local policy impacts, or underlying causes of vacancy.

**Learning Reflection**  
Creating this map deepened my understanding of how classification and color decisions shape narrative and interpretation in thematic mapping.
