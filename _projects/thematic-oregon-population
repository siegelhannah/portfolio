## Overview

These thematic maps show selected population variables at the county level in Oregon using different symbolizations.

## Cartographer’s Statement

**Audience & Purpose**  
This map is intended for a broad audience interested in Oregon’s demographic geography. The purpose is to clearly communicate county-level population differences.

**Concepts, Narrative & Design Choices**  
This project compares how different symbolization techniques shape interpretation of county-level population data in Oregon. Total population is mapped with dot density masked to residential land cover to show where people actually live within counties. Population under 18 is displayed using normalized graduated symbols to allow comparison across counties of different sizes. Bachelor’s degree holders are shown with proportional symbols using raw counts to emphasize regional concentration. Foreign-born population is represented with normalized bar chart symbols to highlight proportional differences independent of total population.

**Data Sources & Processing**  
Population data were sourced from publicly available Census datasets and joined to county boundary shapefiles. Variables were normalized where appropriate to support fair comparison.

**Reflection**  
This project broadened my understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different symbolization techniques.
