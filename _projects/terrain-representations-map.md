## Overview

This map visualizes terrain and elevation around Tahkenitch Lake, emphasizing landform structure and topographic variation.

## Cartographer’s Statement

**Audience & Purpose**  
This map is intended for a general audience interested in physical geography, outdoor spaces, and landscape visualization. The goal is to highlight terrain in a way that is both informative and visually engaging.

**Concepts & Narrative**  
The map is informed by principles of relief representation and terrain visualization, focusing on how elevation and landform shape viewer perception of place.

**Design Choices**  
Hillshade and elevation representations were used to emphasize terrain while preserving readability. Color and contrast were carefully adjusted to enhance depth without overwhelming other map elements. Scale and extent were chosen to frame the lake within its surrounding landscape context.

**Data Sources & Processing**  
Elevation data were sourced from publicly available DEM datasets. Data were processed to generate terrain representations, with smoothing and resolution choices made to balance realism and clarity.

**Ethical & Accuracy Considerations**  
Terrain exaggeration and visualization choices can influence perception. Care was taken to avoid misleading distortion while still enhancing legibility.

**Relationship to Place**  
My interest in this landscape shaped a design approach that emphasizes physical form and spatial experience rather than thematic abstraction.

**Process & Tools**  
The map was created using GIS software, involving experimentation with hillshade parameters, color ramps, and layout refinement.

**Intended Experience**  
I hope viewers gain a stronger sense of the physical character of the landscape and an appreciation for its terrain complexity.

**Limitations**  
This map cannot convey ecological processes, land use, or temporal change and should be understood as a static terrain representation.

**Learning Reflection**  
This project deepened my understanding of terrain visualization techniques and how subtle design adjustments influence spatial interpretation.
