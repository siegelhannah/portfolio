## Overview

This map visualizes terrain and elevation around Tahkenitch Lake in different ways, emphasizing landform structure and topographic variation. The last map also serves as a subtle reference map for navigation.

## Cartographer’s Statement

**Audience & Purpose**  
This map is intended for an audience seeking different examples of landscape/terrain visualization. The goal is to highlight terrain in a way that is both informative and visually engaging. I aim for viewers to gain a stronger sense of the physical character of the landscape.

**Concepts, Narrative & Design Choices**  
This project examines how different terrain visualization techniques affect interpretation of the same landscape. I created eight terrain representations of the Tahkenitch Lake area by combining elevation, hillshade, land cover, contours, and orthoimagery in different ways.

The first seven maps focus on terrain, ranging from expressive, three-dimensional visualizations to designs emphasizing clarity and precision. The final map functions as a reference map, using subtle terrain with clear navigation layers. Together, these maps demonstrate how symbology choices can shift a map’s purpose between evocative visualization and functional reference.

**Relationship to Place**  
I have a personal interest in this location: the national forest has many hiking and backpacking trails that I've been on and are very beautiful!

**Learning Reflection**  
This project deepened my understanding of terrain visualization techniques and the balance between informative, data-driven design and artistic, evocative design choices.
