This project utilizes **supervised classification models** (random forest classification) and **remote sensing techniques** (band composites, NDVI change detection) to analyze **satellite imagery**, assessing vegetation damage and recovery in the context of the Eagle Creek forest fire.  

Tools and methods include: **Python Scikit-Learn, ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, and Google Earth**.
