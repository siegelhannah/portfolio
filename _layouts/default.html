      <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Hannah Siegel, and I'm a senior data science student at the University of Oregon.</p>
      <p>My interests lie in using data analysis techniques to tackle larger, spatial/geographic issues.</p>
      <p>Within my degree, I have a concentration in geography, which has not only given me practice with cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting large datasets, but also with geospatial software and data visualization across location and space.</p>
      <p>I'm especially excited about diving into topics concerning <strong>our environment</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong>, and <strong>climate change</strong>.</p>
