#### Top Technical Skills: Python, C, GIS & Spatial Analysis Software, SQL, Excel/Tableau

Hello! My name is Hannah Siegel, and I'm a third-year data science student at the University of Oregon. My interests lie in using data analysis techniques to tackle larger, spatial/geographic issues. Within my degree, I have a concentration in geography, which has not only given me practice with cleaning, analyzing and interpreting large datasets, but also with geospatial software and data visualization across location and space.  I'm especially excited in diving into topics concerning our environment, sustainability, and climate change.<br><br>


## Education:
B.S. in Data Science and Spatial Data Science, Concentration in Geography at the University of Oregon
(Expected graduation June 2026)
From my coursework, I have experience applying statistical & machine learning techniques to large datasets, including classification and regression, predictively modeling both continuous and categorical variables. I have learned how to fficiently manage large data sets using advanced functions in Python/Pandas, SQL, and other packages for data visualization and analysis. <br><br>

## Relevant Experience in Data Science:
#### Data Analyst Intern @ Helping Irish Hosts (_July 2024 - August 2024_)
- Experience in data cleaning, data processing, creating dashboards & visualizations

#### Data Science Learning Assistant @ University of Oregon (_September 2024 - Present_)
- Experience tutoring/teaching Python, statistics, and data science fundamentals

#### Mobile App Intern @ Phase4 Mobile (_Summers 2019 - 2021_)
- This first introduced me to analyzing numerical charts/tables/graphs to gain insights about business success/revenue
